- **There are broadly two options for delivering a payload**:
    - Send a URL where a payload can be downloaded.
    - Attach the payload to the phishing email.

- Any file downloaded via a browser (outside of a trusted zone) will be tainted with the "Mark of the Web" (**MOTW**).  In a nutshell, this is a data stream that gets embedded into the file which says it was downloaded from an untrusted location. The zone data can be read with PowerShell.
- Files that are emailed "internally" via a compromised Exchange mailbox are not tagged with a Zone Identifier.
```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\bfarmer\Downloads> gc .\test.txt -Stream Zone.Identifier
[ZoneTransfer]
ZoneId=3
HostUrl=http://nickelviper.com/test.txt
```
**The possible zones are**:

0 => Local computer
1 => Local intranet
2 => Trusted sites
3 => Internet
4 => Restricted sites


- Both **Windows SmartScreen** and **Office Protected** View  often don't stop files from being opened or executed, but they require the user to click through more warning boxes which lower the likelihood of your phish being successful. 
- If MS Office `block macros downloaded from the Internet` is `enabled`, a user cannot run a macro-enabled document even if they wanted to.
